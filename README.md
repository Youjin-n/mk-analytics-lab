# 🧪 MK Analytics & Security Lab

## 🚀 About This Repository

Welcome to my  **R&D (Research & Development) Laboratory** .

This repository serves as the "scratchpad" and documentation hub for my intensive 24-week journey into  **Data Science, MLOps, and AI Security** . Here, I document my learning process, code snippets, algorithm solutions, and experimental scripts before they are implemented into production-grade projects.

> **Note:** The code in this repository is experimental and educational. For production-ready, architectural projects, please refer to my **Flagship Repositories** below.

## 🏆 Flagship Projects (The "Big 4")

While this repo tracks my  *daily progress* , the following repositories demonstrate my ability to build  *end-to-end systems* :
